Sanjeevani – Smart Herbal Supply Chain & Farmer Empowerment Platform
===================================================================

[SIH 2025 Project Badge]

Description
-----------
Sanjeevani is a full-stack solution built to modernize and secure the herbal supply chain—from farmer registration to quality verification, traceability, and consumer transparency. It streamlines the traditionally unorganized herbal market using IVR onboarding, OCR-based documentation, blockchain-backed authenticity, and a RAG-powered knowledge system, ensuring that every herb sold is verified, traceable, and trustworthy.

This project was developed for the Smart India Hackathon, aligning with the goal of improving supply-chain transparency and empowering rural farmers with technology.

Features
--------
- IVR Registration – Allows rural farmers to register without a smartphone using Asterisk-powered voice menus.
- OCR-Based Onboarding – Automatically extracts farmer details from documents using OCR for quick and accurate registration.
- Multilingual & Memory-Based System – Supports multiple languages and retains conversational context for smoother user interactions.
- Blockchain Traceability – Hyperledger-powered immutable ledger ensures herb authenticity and transparent tracking from farm to shelf.
- RAG Knowledge Chatbot – Provides real-time insights, herb info, and process guidance using a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation setup.
- Android APK + PWA – Mobile-first access for farmers, verifiers, labs, and consumers.
- Verifier & Lab Workflow Automation – Seamless document approvals, test reports, and batch verification.

Usage & Demo
------------
1. Farmer Registration  
   - Call the IVR number → follow voice prompts → farmer account is created automatically.  
   - Alternatively, use the app/web portal and upload documents → OCR extracts details → submit.

2. Verification Flow  
   - Verifier reviews farmer & herb batch documents.  
   - Lab uploads chemical/biological test results.  
   - Blockchain entry is created for each approved batch.

3. Consumer Transparency  
   - Scan QR on product packaging → view complete herb journey, test reports, and farm details.

4. Demo Flow for Judges  
   - Start with Farmer Registration (IVR / OCR)  
   - Show Verifier Dashboard → Lab Workflow → Blockchain Traceability View  
   - End with Consumer Page scan result
