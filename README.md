# SIH_FINAL-PS25027

Our team GuptaSquad06 from Government Engineering College Jabalpur is working on Problem Statement SIH25027. The project focuses on building a blockchain based solution for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025.

## Project Title

Sanjeevani  
Smart Herbal Supply Chain and Farmer Empowerment Platform

## Project Description

Sanjeevani is a full stack digital platform designed to modernize and secure the herbal supply chain. It enables complete traceability of Ayurvedic herbs from farmer registration to consumer verification. The system addresses challenges such as lack of transparency, authenticity issues, and farmer accessibility in the traditionally unorganized herbal market.

The platform integrates IVR based onboarding for rural farmers, OCR powered document processing, blockchain backed authenticity records, and a knowledge driven AI assistant. Each herb batch is verified, traceable, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle.

This project is developed specifically for Smart India Hackathon 2025 with the objective of empowering farmers and improving supply chain transparency using advanced technologies.

## Key Features

IVR based farmer registration that allows onboarding without a smartphone using voice calls  
OCR based document onboarding for automatic extraction of farmer and herb details  
Multilingual and memory based interaction system for smooth conversational workflows  
Blockchain powered traceability using an immutable ledger for authenticity verification  
RAG based knowledge chatbot providing herb information and process guidance  
Mobile first access through Android application and progressive web application  
Verifier and laboratory workflow automation for approvals and testing reports  

## Technology Stack

Frontend developed using MERN stack and progressive web application architecture  
Mobile application built using Android Studio  
Backend services implemented using Node.js and Express  
AI and ML components including OCR processing and RAG pipeline  
Blockchain implementation using Hyperledger Fabric  
IVR communication handled using Asterisk  
REST APIs and cloud based deployment for scalability  

## System Usage and Demo Flow

Farmer registration can be done by calling the IVR number and following voice prompts which automatically creates the farmer profile. Farmers can also register using the web or mobile app by uploading documents which are processed through OCR for data extraction.

Verifiers review submitted farmer and herb batch information. Laboratories upload chemical and biological test results. Once approved, blockchain entries are created for each herb batch to ensure immutable traceability.

Consumers can scan the QR code on the product packaging to view the complete journey of the herb including farm details verification status and laboratory reports.

For judging demonstration the flow begins with farmer registration using IVR or OCR onboarding. This is followed by verifier dashboard and laboratory workflow. The demonstration concludes with blockchain traceability and consumer side QR scan results.
